I use this repository to dump my solutions of exercises and some summaries I create for classes. Here you'll find a list of all the classes I took with a brief description of what this class is

## Contents

### I.BA_AD.F23 - Algorithms & Datastructures

### I.BA_ANLIS - Calculus

ANLIS is one of the more intriguing subjects when you begin your studies. It's a mix of studentsâ€”some already familiar with the material and others completely new to calculus. If you're among those who are unfamiliar with integrals and derivatives, you might find yourself learning most of it just before the exams. However, you'll realize it's not as difficult as it seems.

### I.BA_CNA.F2301 - Computer & Network Architecture

[View](I.BA_CNA.F2301/)

### I.BA_DMATH.H23 - Discrete Mathematics

DMATH is considered one of the tougher classes at HSLU for many students. The course delves into the concepts outlined in Rosen's book: Discrete Mathematics and its Applications. Initially, it might not be enjoyable, but as you progress through topics like Number Theory and Graph Theory, you'll understand why it is important to know the basics of it for a software engineer.
