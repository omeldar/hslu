# VSK - Verteilte Systeme und Komponenten

## Build Tools

The requirements for VSK were the following:

- Oracle Java JDK (incl. JRE), version 21.0.2 LTS
- Apache Maven 3.9.6

In this folder you'll find a `Dockerfile` and a `docker-compose.yml` to use in order to build the project. The container has a volume mapped so that you can directly work with IntellIJ or any IDE on the project. You might need to tell the IDE where to find the jdk and maven installations.
