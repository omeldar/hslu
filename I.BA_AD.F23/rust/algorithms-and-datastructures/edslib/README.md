# ELIB

The datastructures and algorithms created in this library are part of some exercises at the Lucerne University of Applied Sciences and Arts.

I do not have much experience with rust. No guarantee that the datastructures all work as intended.

To analyze and describe the algorithms made for the custom data structures, I use the
*Big O-Notation*, which is a tool used to describe the time complexity of algorithms.

## Binary Search Tree

A binary tree allows us to do an easy binary search of items in a large dataset.
Using a binary tree, we can reduce the time complexity from O(N) to O(log N)
