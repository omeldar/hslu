# Classes I took

### I.BA_AD.F23 - Algorithms & Datastructures

This is exactly what you think it is. Its about creating data structures yourself (which you're being told to not do in general) and implementing algorithms in the worst possible language for implementing algorithms: Java. You'll have a great time with the weekly exercises that can take up to 6 hours to complete if you're doing it properly. But otherwise this class is actually interesting and gives you some deeper insights in programming.

### I.BA_ANLIS - Calculus

ANLIS is one of the more intriguing subjects when you begin your studies. It's a mix of students—some already familiar with the material and others completely new to calculus. If you're among those who are unfamiliar with integrals and derivatives, you might find yourself learning most of it just before the exams. However, you'll realize it's not as difficult as it seems.

### I.BA_CNA.F2301 - Computer & Network Architecture

Just from the name, you'd imagine this class to be a fascinating dive into an interesting topic. And sure, in the grand scheme of things, the subject matter is quite appealing. But the reality? It's more about becoming a professional rote memorizer. Meaning, you'll learn information through repetition without necessarily understanding the meaning or context. Imagine sitting in your first exam, staring at a question like, 'How many transistors reside in a DDR5 RAM memory cell?' with only a text input for an answer option, pondering the 8 sets of 60 slides each, desperately trying to recall information you've never stumbled upon before. The final exam? Its a game I like to call 'educated guessing' — a multiple-choice affair where you use what you know but end up second-guessing yourself more often than not.

### I.BA_DMATH.H23 - Discrete Mathematics

DMATH is considered one of the tougher classes at HSLU for many students. The course delves into the concepts outlined in Rosen's book: Discrete Mathematics and its Applications. Initially, it might not be enjoyable, but as you progress through topics like Number Theory and Graph Theory, you'll understand why it is important to know the basics of it as a software engineer.

### I.BA_FKOM.F23 - Professional Communication

This class is about communication — I dont really know how to describe it precisely since I'm not quite sure what exactly we learned. It felt like a throwback to mandatory school days, with plenty of classes on topics that I wasn't really interested in.

### I.BA_ISF.H23 - Information Security Fundamentals

ISF, or as I suggest renaming it to PRE (Professor Reverse Engineering), supposedly delves into the basics of information security. Within this class, you'll realize that finding an excuse to skip class may not be necessary because, well, hardly anyone attends. Okay, that's an exaggeration — except for the ICS (Cyber Security) students who actually show up. If caught chatting while the teacher talks about hiding backups at your friend's house as a security measure against ransomware attacks, the ICS enthusiasts will hush you, believing there's some gold nugget of wisdom buried in there. Oh, and brace yourself for the Q&A sessions! They're less about questions and more of an opportunity for everyone to gather and have a field day, playing "What's Wrong with ISF?" It's almost like a community bonding exercise. Why Professor Reverse Engineering? Well, get ready to invest more time decoding the professor's exercise intentions and identifying the possibly wrong answers they've deemed correct for those weekly tests, rather than actually grasping those sought-after security fundamentals.

### I.BA_LIOS.F2301 - Linux OS

LIOS focuses entirely on the Linux OS. If you've tinkered with a few Linux servers and do some prep before the exam, attending class might not be necessary. The exam isn't overly difficult, but you'll need to invest some effort to pass.

### I.BA_OOP.H22 - Object-Oriented Programming

This is precisely what you'd expect—an introduction to object-oriented programming using Java. For software engineers, this class is a breeze.

### I.BA_PLAB.H2201 - Programming Lab

This is like OOP (object-oriented programming), but trickier because the students are the ones running the class (Yes, really, everyone will lead one class during the semester). There's an extra exam at the end, too. So, if you're considering PLAB over OOP, just don't. Unless you're willing to put in the extra work for a worse grade but same amounts of credits.

### I.BA_PMB.F23 - Project Management Basics

In PMB (Project Management Basics), you'll master the art of everything NOT to do while organizing folders and files. It comes with a bonus lesson on discovering that mastering Microsoft Project is like taming a wild beast — feared by many and loved by, well, not many. It's the course where "How little effort can I put in and still pass?"" becomes the mantra. Who knew that avoiding proper folder structuring would become the unexpected highlight of your project management education?

### I.BA_PTA.H22 - Project Team Assignment

As your studies kick off, you'll encounter PTA (Pottering Team Adventure). Some workshops teach you the art of subtly poking fun at the workshop itself without the professor catching on, while others aim to impart tinkering skills. This class seems determined to teach you an early lesson: never fully trust your group mates with their solutions for assignments. The crux of PTA? Well, no one seems to fathom its worth. It's not about teamwork or project work; it's about enduring pointless workshops and lessons. You'll receive glowing praise for your test presentation — your ideas heralded as exceptional and intriguing — only to face scorching critiques on the final exam presentation day. It's a perplexing maze of contradictions.

### I.BA_WEBT_MM.H22 - Web Technologies

When it comes to WEBT, opinions wildly differ depending on who you ask. Ask a Business Information Technology student, and they'll spin tales of it being among the toughest courses around. But venture into the realm of Computer Science, and you'll hear whispers that it's a walk in the park. Truth be told, it's essentially about creating an eyesore of a website using the not-so-beloved web technology, PHP, paired with a web-server software (XAMPP) that's not exactly topping anyone's download list. Sprinkle in a dash of JavaScript to showcase your ability to craft some JS Canvas drawings based on certain inputs, and voilà! You've just described WEBT.
